# Introduction
It talks (mostly) about basic concept of "Cryptography" and somewhat about oceanverse and my experiences about both of them.

# Background
i joined [IIT Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/) on 26th July, 2024 as a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering branch.
Some days after that, [Sudarshan sir](https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan) introduced his initiave of "Missing Semester", which I personaly found very interesting.
So, we were given this [Oceanverse](https://sudarshansudarshan.github.io/ge103/oceanverse/) worksheet to complete. i was (almost) new to coding but because of my interest in the concept, I completed all the questions till 15th August.

### I'll be talking about the last question of [Oceanverse](https://sudarshansudarshan.github.io/ge103/oceanverse/) here which is related to cryptography...
