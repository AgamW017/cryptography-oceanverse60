# New vs Old
Modern cryptography and traditional (or old-age) cryptography differ significantly in their techniques, security assumptions, and applications.

**Traditional Cryptography:** Relied on simple methods and secrecy of algorithms. Vulnerable to frequency analysis and key management issues.

**Modern Cryptography:** Employs advanced mathematical techniques and focuses on the computational difficulty of breaking encryption. Includes both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, with sophisticated key management and protocols ensuring robust security in a connected world.

# Conclusion
Then why we studied traditional methods?

= We should never skip the basics!

Although these methods might be different from encryption in modern age, still it is an good start and gives us basic idea on how Cryptography works.

## I hope you learnt something new today :) and I also hope it felt interesting.
