# What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and information. It involves creating and using codes and ciphers to protect data from unauthorized access and ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
Cryptography is crucial for protecting sensitive information in various applications, including online banking, email communication, and secure data storage. (thanks gpt)

Yes! It has...
We'll be seeing some cryptographic methods of past and prestent now:
